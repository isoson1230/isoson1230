What made me want to start programming
â†“
I became interested in a programming app for children called ``Scrach'' and have been making various games for four years now. It all started when I became interested in programming.

One word
Although I use Scrach, it's my first time programming English text myself, so I still need some training, but I'd like to program many games in the future, so I'd appreciate your help.
